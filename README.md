👋 Greetings! I'm Hamza Mawaz Khan, diving deep into data science at the University at Buffalo. 🎓 With a foundation in computer science, I'm all about using machine learning to tackle complex problems. 💡

At Rafeeq, as a Junior AI Engineer, I boosted delivery efficiency by up to 20% through advanced analytics. 🚀 My work on predictive models for customer behavior not only enhanced efficiency but also showcased the power of AI in transforming businesses. 📈

My AI Internship with Fountech.ai was a playground for innovation, where I explored Bayesian models and reinforcement learning. 🤖

My project portfolio includes an AI-based attendance system 🕒 and a high-accuracy Cyber Attack classifier 🔒, evidence of my hands-on approach to applying AI in practical scenarios.

As the Founding Club Manager and Head of Data & AI at Microsoft Club GIKI, I've led initiatives to cultivate a data-driven mindset among my peers. 🌟

I'm on the lookout for collaborative ventures in AI and data science that push the envelope. Let's connect on [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzamawazkhan/). 🌐
