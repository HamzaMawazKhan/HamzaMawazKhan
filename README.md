👋 Greetings! I'm Hamza Mawaz Khan, diving deep into data science at the University at Buffalo. 🎓 With a foundation in computer science, I'm all about using machine learning to tackle complex problems. 💡

My project portfolio includes an AI-based attendance system 🕒 and a high-accuracy Cyber Attack classifier 🔒, evidence of my hands-on approach to applying AI in practical scenarios.

I'm on the lookout for collaborative ventures in AI and data science that push the envelope. Let's connect on [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzamawazkhan/). 🌐
