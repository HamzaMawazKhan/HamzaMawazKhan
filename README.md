Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience building AI/ML solutions that solve real-world problems across aviation, legal, and e-commerce industries. I specialize in building end-to-end ML pipelines, fine-tuning LLMs, and deploying scalable models on AWS and Azure. Notable wins include slashing last-mile delivery times by 10% with ML Forecasting (FB Prophet) and cutting legal case classification time by 75% via LoRA-fine-tuned LLM. Driven by a mission to turn raw data into strategic impact, I thrive on collaborating with cross-functional teams to bridge technical and business worlds.
