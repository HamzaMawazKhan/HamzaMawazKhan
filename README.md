👋 Greetings! I'm Hamza Mawaz Khan, diving deep into data science at the University at Buffalo. With a foundation in computer science, I'm all about using machine learning to tackle complex problems. 

My project portfolio showcases my diverse application of AI in real-world scenarios. It includes an AI-based attendance system, a high-accuracy cyber attack classifier, and a store sales demand forecasting model just to name a few. This selection of projects is evidence of my hands-on approach to implementing AI in practical settings. 

I'm on the lookout for collaborative ventures in AI and data science that push the envelope. Let's connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzamawazkhan 🌐
